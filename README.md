# MongoDB $inc operator error
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations.  The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, providing an invalid value (e.g., a string) results in unexpected behavior or an error.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
